Background
==========

These articles explain the concepts, theory, and design decisions behind scikit-downscale and statistical downscaling methods.

.. note::
   Background articles are explanatory and conceptual. They provide context and deeper understanding but are not task-oriented.

Coming Soon
-----------

We are actively developing background articles. Future topics will include:

Statistical Downscaling Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* What is statistical downscaling?
* Bias correction vs. spatial disaggregation
* When to use statistical vs. dynamical downscaling
* Understanding quantile mapping
* Stationarity assumptions in downscaling

Method Comparisons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Comparing downscaling methods: strengths and weaknesses
* Performance metrics for evaluating downscaling
* Handling extremes in downscaling
* Temporal and spatial consistency

Design and Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Why scikit-learn's API?
* Pointwise vs. spatial downscaling approaches
* Integration with Xarray and Dask
* Extensibility and custom methods
