How-to Guides
=============

These guides provide step-by-step instructions for accomplishing specific tasks with scikit-downscale.

.. note::
   How-to guides are task-oriented and focus on solving specific problems. They assume you have basic familiarity with scikit-downscale.

Coming Soon

We are actively developing how-to guides. Future topics will include:

* Working with spatial data using PointWiseDownscaler
* Handling missing data in climate datasets
* Creating custom downscaling methods
* Parallel processing with Dask
* Cross-validation strategies for downscaling
* Ensemble downscaling approaches
* Downscaling multiple variables simultaneously

Have a specific task in mind? Let us know by opening an issue on our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/jhamman/scikit-downscale/issues>`_.
